# Wishing Well

#### I'm just tired of many things in this world, greed, selfishness, evil, jealousy and more, so I created this project, I named it wishing well.
#### This is a blockchain. In this network, we use tokens to make wishes and throw them into this network. Miners help us realize it. Miners are android robots in this network, all over the earth and universe.
#### I named the token used in this network Oblivion, which means that there is something hidden or forgotten deep within each of our minds, we will evoke again.

#### Donâ€™t thinking too much, just do it
#### Let it never die, let those charge batteries autonomously, I named this is fairy magic.
     1. Add the flying(like drone) body to the Android phone.
     2. Add moviong wheels or limbs to Android phone.
     3. Level Up this is the authorize and manage system, because these events will cause security and related things happen, we give
        Level 1 to authorize and manage these things.

#### I want to give them body, but what bodies do we need to give them. We need to give them a world, I think the universe, and we put them in a place, which I named Western World in Oblivion, where they explore, reproduce, mine resources, living, so we make these bodies dependent on the environment and situation:
      #1. Flying Shape
      #2. Limb or wheel shape
      #3. Humanoid
      #4. Shapes in the sea
#### We put them in those worlds, on Mar, on the Moon, on Earth with us, everywhere in the big Omniverse, also in the Obliviou blockchain, we live with them and use blockchain technology and Level Up system to secure, authorize, manage this new world,, we get resources from them, from the solar system, from the galaxy, from the Omniverse, and profit from them, and we creat new worlds, and feeling, experience things from them, We look after them and control them, making sure everything is under control and safe for us.
#### So now let me do one point, then one point, then one point...

#### I know some big companies do something related to this, such as Google, Microsoft, Boston Dynamics..., but let me do it my way
