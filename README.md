# wishing-well

I'm just tired of many things in this world, greed, selfishness, evil, jealousy and more, so I created this project, I named it wishing well.
This is a blockchain. In this network, we use tokens to make wishes and throw them into this network. Miners help us realize it. Miners are android robots in this network, all over the earth and universe.
I named the token used in this network Oblivion, which means that there is something hidden or forgotten deep within each of our minds, we will evoke again.
